# Hello World.ws.java

That's right, this project provides java classes for generating and testing [whitespace](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php) programs. For instance to say Hello World, using WhiteSpace. How cool and unnecessarily complicated is that!

Currently, Hello World is pretty much all you can do and most likely that's the way this will stay. Though it would of course be awesome beyond words to see a complete implementation of wspace! Contributions welcome!

## Requirements

* Running a .ws program assumes the [wspace](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/download.php) binary is in your path.
* Patience.
